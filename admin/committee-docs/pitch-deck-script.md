# SIRSI PITCH DECK SCRIPT
## 5-Minute Investor Presentation (30 seconds per slide)

---

## SLIDE 1: OPENING
**[0:00 - 0:30]**

"Imagine describing your infrastructure needs in plain English and having it built instantly. 

Hi, I'm Cylton Collymore, and I've spent 20 years watching brilliant entrepreneurs fail—not because their ideas were bad, but because infrastructure complexity killed their momentum.

Today, I'm introducing Sirsi—the AI that turns conversation into code, so you can focus on building your business, not your infrastructure."

---

## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM
**[0:30 - 1:00]**

"Here's the brutal reality: Companies spend $250,000 per engineer annually on DevOps. Teams waste 68% of their time configuring infrastructure instead of building features. And 90% of startups can't even afford basic AI infrastructure.

The result? Innovation dies in configuration files. Brilliant ideas never see the light of day. The future is being built by the few who can afford armies of engineers."

---

## SLIDE 3: THE SOLUTION
**[1:00 - 1:30]**

"Sirsi changes everything. Zero code required—just describe what you need. We deliver 56% faster development, cutting deployment time from 9 weeks to 4. And we slash costs by 63%.

How? Our AI understands infrastructure like a senior architect but builds like a team of engineers. One of our customers, Assiduous Realty, built their entire AI platform with just one developer, saving months and thousands of dollars."

---

## SLIDE 4: COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
**[1:30 - 2:00]**

"You might ask: 'How is Sirsi different?' 

Unlike Dr. Migrate or Pulumi, we require zero coding knowledge. Unlike GitHub Spark, we handle full deployment and enterprise infrastructure. We're the only platform that combines natural language processing, complete deployment automation, and enterprise-grade security.

Simply put: We're the only solution that makes infrastructure accessible to everyone, not just engineers."

---

## SLIDE 5: MARKET OPPORTUNITY
**[2:00 - 2:30]**

"We're targeting a massive $547 billion cloud infrastructure market. Our serviceable market—infrastructure automation—is $89 billion. And the AI-driven infrastructure segment we're pioneering? $12 billion and growing exponentially.

Every company needs infrastructure. We're making it accessible to all of them. This isn't just a big market—it's an inevitable transformation of how infrastructure gets built."

---

## SLIDE 6: THE FOUNDER
**[2:30 - 3:00]**

"I've lived this problem. Twenty years managing DevOps for enterprises. MIT-trained full-stack developer. I've secured infrastructure for travel.state.gov and protected the US Passport database as Oracle's Lead Vault Architect.

Previously, I raised $1 million for my last startup, backed by Techstars, Visa, and Hedera. I've seen infrastructure complexity from every angle—from startups to government. Sirsi is my solution to democratize technology for every entrepreneur."

---

## SLIDE 7: TRACTION & PARTNERSHIPS
**[3:00 - 3:30]**

"We're not just an idea—we're building momentum. Alpha launches September 2025. We have three customers in our pipeline, including a signed LOI with Assiduous Realty. Three patents pending on our AI infrastructure generation technology.

With $1.5 million, we unlock partnerships with AWS for credits and go-to-market support, NVIDIA for AI infrastructure, and Hedera for Web3 enterprise connections. These aren't hopes—these are conversations already in progress."

---

## SLIDE 8: FINANCIALS
**[3:30 - 4:00]**

"Our unit economics are exceptional: $299 monthly per customer, $50 customer acquisition cost, giving us a 6-to-1 LTV/CAC ratio. At scale, we maintain 85% gross margins.

Our path is clear: Year one, $2 million with 600 customers. Year three, $18 million. Year five, $73 million ARR with 20,000 customers. These aren't dreams—they're based on conservative 3% market penetration in our target segment."

---

## SLIDE 9: INVESTMENT ASK
**[4:00 - 4:30]**

"We're raising $1.5 million in pre-seed funding, with $200K already in active discussions.

This investment completes our alpha platform, enables multi-cloud support, and builds enterprise-grade security. It gets us to 1,000 customers in 18 months and positions us for Series A.

We're offering early investors the chance to own part of the infrastructure revolution—before the market realizes that coding infrastructure is obsolete."

---

## SLIDE 10: CLOSING/CONTACT
**[4:30 - 5:00]**

"The future of infrastructure isn't about writing better code—it's about eliminating code entirely. Every company will build this way. The only question is whether they'll use Sirsi or wait for someone else to copy us.

We're not just building a product. We're defining a new category. And we're going to own it.

Let's build the future together. I'm Cylton Collymore—let's talk about how Sirsi transforms your portfolio. 

Thank you."

## PRESENTATION TIPS:

### Pacing Guidelines:
- **Speak clearly** at ~140-150 words per minute
- **Pause briefly** between major points for emphasis
- **Make eye contact** when delivering key metrics
- **Gesture naturally** when discussing scale and growth

### Key Emphasis Points:
- Problem: "$250K per engineer" and "90% can't afford AI"
- Solution: "Zero code required" and "56% faster"
- Traction: "3 customers in pipeline" and "Patents pending"
- Financials: "$73M ARR" and "6:1 LTV/CAC"
- Ask: "$1.5M pre-seed" and "1,000 customers in 18 months"

### Backup Responses (if asked to elaborate):
- **Technology**: "Proprietary NLP trained on 10 years of infrastructure patterns"
- **Competition**: "2-year head start with 3 provisional patents"
- **Team expansion**: "Hiring 2 senior engineers and 1 sales lead post-funding"
- **Customer pipeline**: "Currently in paid pilots with 2 enterprise clients"
- **Exit strategy**: "Acquisition target for AWS, Microsoft, or Google in 3-5 years"

### Practice Notes:
1. Run through the full presentation 5 times before presenting
2. Time each slide during practice to ensure 30-second pacing
3. Have a water bottle nearby but don't drink during presentation
4. Stand if presenting virtually, sit if in-person across a table
5. End with confidence and direct ask for next steps
